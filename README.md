# Q-Summit 2024 , Hackathon, Mannheim Germany

Happy to be a member of the **winner team** (1st place) at the hackathon of **Q-Summit 2024, Germany’s most important conference for entrepreneurship and innovation!** ✌️🥳🥳
<br />
We had 2 days full of fun, creativity and networking with great leaders, brilliant minds and very nice participants.
<br />
There were many other prototypes that I personally like and I wish that they become products one day =)
<br />
Till the next Summit! 🌸
